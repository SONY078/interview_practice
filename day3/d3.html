        <b>1.What are promises and why do we need them?</b>
        Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing
        with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.
        A Promise has four states: 
        fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
        rejected: Action related to the promise failed
        pending: Promise is still pending i.e. not fulfilled or rejected yet
        settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected
       <b>Benefits of Promises
          ..................... </b> 
        Improves Code Readability
        Better handling of asynchronous operations
        Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
        Better Error Handling

        <b>2.What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</b>
        An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it.
         The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based 
        behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
        The body of an async function can be thought of as being split by zero or more await expressions.
        Top-level code, up to and including the first await expression (if there is one), is run synchronously.
        In this way, an async function without an await expression will run synchronously. 
        If there is an await expression inside the function body, 
        however, the async function will always complete asynchronously.

        <b>3.What is hoisting?</b>
        JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears 
        to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, 
        prior to execution of the code.
        Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared
        Variable and class declarations are also hoisted, so they too can be referenced before they are declared. 
        Note that doing so can lead to unexpected errors, and is not generally recommended.

        <b>4.What is the DOM?</b>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
         It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
        The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way,
         programming languages can interact with the page.

        <b>5.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</b>
        <b>undefined: </b>It is a JavaScript keyword that has a special meaning.
        Everything which gets a space in memory will contain undefined until we assign a value to that memory space.

        <b>not defined:</b> In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors 
        that JavaScript will throw when someone accesses the variable which is not inside the memory heap.

        <b>NaN :</b>In JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number". In JavaScript, 
        NaN is a number that is not a legal number. The Global NaN property is the same as the Number. Nan property.

        <b>6.How many operators do we have in JS ?</b>
        JavaScript includes following categories of operators.
        Arithmetic Operators : Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations between numeric operands.
        +  -  *  /  %
        Comparison Operators :JavaScript provides comparison operators that compare two operands and return a boolean value true or false.
        ==  === >  <  >=  <== 
        Logical Operators :In JavaScript, the logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions. JavaScript provides the following logical operators.
        
        &&  || !

        Assignment Operators : JavaScript provides the assignment operators to assign values to variables with less key strokes.
        = +=  -=  *=  /=  %=

        Ternary Operator :JavaScript provides a special operator called ternary operator :? that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition. This is the short form of the if else condition.
        ?  :

        increment/decrement :The ++ and -- operators are unary operators.
         It works with either left or right operand only. When used with the left operand, 
         e.g., x++, it will increase the value of x when the program control goes to the next statement.
          In the same way, when it is used with the right operand, e.g., ++x, it will increase the value of x there only. Therefore,
         x++ is called post-increment, and ++x is called pre-increment.

        <b>7.What are pure functions?</b>
        A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result 
        if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state or data
         change during a program's execution. Rather, it only depends on its input arguments.

        <b>8.What is callback hell</b>
        Callback Hell is a big issue caused by coding with complex nested callbacks. 
        Here, each and every callback takes an argument that is a result of the previous callbacks. In this manner,
        The code structure looks like a pyramid, making it difficult to read and maintain
        a callback hell is defined as a nested callback functions which are complex to handle.
        Callback hell is a phenomenon that afflicts a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute 
        multiple asynchronous operations one after the other.
        In this, each callback takes arguments that have been obtained as a result of previous callbacks. 
        This kind of callback structure leads to lesser code readability and maintainability. 
        We can avoid the callback hell with the help of Promises. Promises in javascript are a way 
        to handle asynchronous operations in Node.  

        <b>9.What is promise chaining</b>
        Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing
        with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.
        Sometimes, we need to execute two or more related asynchronous operations,
        where the next operation starts with the result from the previous step. For example:

        <b>10.What are arrow functions?</b>
        Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
        It allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions
        Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax.
        datatype functionname = () =>
        {
            .....stmts ;
        }
        
        <b>11.Give an example of async/await</b>
        An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it.
        The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based 
       behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
       The body of an async function can be thought of as being split by zero or more await expressions.
       Top-level code, up to and including the first await expression (if there is one), is run synchronously.
       In this way, an async function without an await expression will run synchronously. 
       If there is an await expression inside the function body, 
       however, the async function will always complete asynchronously.
