        1.call() , apply() and bind()
            these are invoking or calling functions.
            call(): 
                accepts additional parameters.
                expects all parameters passed individually.
                binds the this value, invokes the function, and allows you to pass a list of arguments.

            apply():
                works as call() but the difference is expects an array of all the arguments.
                binds the this value, invokes the function, and allows you to pass arguments as an array.

            
            bind():
                it accepts aruguments that we are given.
                when called, this keyword set to the provided value.
                binds the this value, returns a new function, and allows you to pass in a list of arguments.

        PROTOTYPE:
        ---------
        a prototype is an object which is associated with every object and function in javascript.and the object's prototype is not visible.
        The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default 
        in JavaScript, where function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype 
        property is not visible.


        PROTOTYPE CHAINING :
        --------------------
        in javascript ,functions and arrays are objects.
        an every object has a prototype. prototype is a default property of every object and it holds another object 
        That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.
        Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. 
        That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with 
        null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.


        CREATION PHASE AND EXECUTION PHASE :
        ----------------------------------
        Javascript is a synchronous programming language.
        Creation Phase : it runs two times. in the first time, it stores the function declarations in the memory.
                        in the second run , assigns undefined to all the variables. In the event of a conflict between
                        variable and function declaration name then that variable is ignored.
        Execution Phase : in this phase, all the variables are assigned with values and the functions were executed.



        OBJECTS :
        ---------
                Object is a non-primitive datatype which is used to store collection of data.
                an object has property and type.
                In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
                Each key-value pair is called a property.
                The key of a property can be a string. And the value of a property can be any value, 
                e.g., a string, a number, an array, and even a function.
                JavaScript provides you with many ways to create an object. The most commonly used one 
                is to use the object literal notation.

        FUNCTION CONSTRUCTORS:
        ----------------------
        The Function constructor creates a new Function object.
        The Function constructor creates a new Function object. Calling the constructor directly can create 
        functions dynamically, but suffers from security and similar (but far less significant) performance issues 
        to Global_Objects/eval. However, unlike eval, the Function constructor creates functions which execute in 
        the global scope only.

        INHERITANCE:
        ------------
            inheritance is a concept in javascript which is used to inherit the properties from parent functions.

        CALLBACK:
        ---------
        A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
        callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.
        Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that 
        it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.
        Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will 
        run right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps 
        us safe from problems and errors.

        setTimeout:
        -----------
        The setTimeout() method calls a function after a number of milliseconds.
        it never execcutes by javascript engine. it is executed by event loop.
        The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or 
        specified piece of code once the timer expires.
        The setTimeout function is a native JavaScript function. It sets a timer (a countdown set in milliseconds) 
        for an execution of a callback function, calling the function upon completion of the timer.        

        CALLBACK HELL:
        --------------
                a callback hell is defined as a nested callback functions which are complex to handle.
                Callback hell is a phenomenon that afflicts a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute 
                multiple asynchronous operations one after the other.
                In this, each callback takes arguments that have been obtained as a result of previous callbacks. 
                This kind of callback structure leads to lesser code readability and maintainability. 
                We can avoid the callback hell with the help of Promises. Promises in javascript are a way 
                to handle asynchronous operations in Node.                
       
        EVENT LOOP AND CALL STACK:
        ---------------------------
                event loop is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
                call stack is a stack which stores the instructions as a LIFO. 
                Call Stack - A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in 
                a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls 
                multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what 
                functions are called from within that function, etc.
                The call stack is a LIFO queue (Last In, First Out). The event loop continuously checks the call stack 
                to see if there's any function that needs to run. While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to 
                the call stack and executes each one in order.
