        1.call() , apply() and bind()
            these are invoking or calling functions.

            call(): 
                accepts additional parameters.
                expects all parameters passed individually.


            apply():
                works as call() but the difference is expects an array of all the arguments.
            
            bind():
                it accepts aruguments that we are given.
                when called, this keyword set to the provided value.

        PROTOTYPE:
        ---------
        a prototype is an object which is associated with every object and function in javascript.and the object's prototype is not visible.

        PROTOTYPE CHAINING :
        --------------------

        in javascript ,functions and arrays are objects.
        an every object has a prototype. prototype is a default property of every object and it holds another object 
        That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.

        CREATION PHASE AND EXECUTION PHASE :
        ----------------------------------
        Javascript is a synchronous programming language.
        Creation Phase : it runs two times. in the first time, it stores the function declarations in the memory.
                        in the second run , assigns undefined to all the variables.
        Execution Phase : in this phase, all the variables are assigned with values and the functions were executed. 


        OBJECTS :
        ---------
                Object is a non-primitive datatype which is used to store collection of data.
                an object has property and type.

        FUNCTION CONSTRUCTORS:
        ----------------------
        The Function constructor creates a new Function object.

        INHERITANCE:
        ------------
            inheritance is a concept in javascript which is used to inherit the properties from parent functions.

        CALLBACK:
        ---------
        A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
        callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.

        setTimeout:
        -----------
        The setTimeout() method calls a function after a number of milliseconds.

        CALLBACK HELL:
        --------------
                a callback hell is defined as a nested callback functions which are complex to handle.
       
        EVENT LOOP AND CALL STACK:
        ---------------------------
                event loop is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
                call stack is a stack which stores the instructions as a LIFO.
