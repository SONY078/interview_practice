        <b>9.Explain passed by value and passed by reference</b>
        
        <u>"Passing by value"</u> means that you pass the actual value of the variable into the function
        Pass By Value: In case of Value Type - It is just another copy of Value Type Variable.
        In case of Reference Type - It is a copy of reference (or pointer) to exact location where memory is 
        assigned in heap.

        <u>"Passing by reference"</u> means that you pass the variable itself into the function (not just the value).
        Pass By Reference:
        for Reference type variable - passing it to another method by using keyword is only useful in the scenario 
        when the passed variable can be reassigned in the called method. It means :let's say - Outside (caller) 
        method A inside (called) method BReference Type Object R -passed to method B from method A then 
        if you reassign the memory location of Object R in method B then those changes wouldn't be seen in Method 
        A of Object R unless you pass the object R using ref keyword (i.e pass by reference).
